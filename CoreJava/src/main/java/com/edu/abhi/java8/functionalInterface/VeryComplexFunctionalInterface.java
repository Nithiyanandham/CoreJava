 *         Interface can extend another interface and in case the Interface it
 *         is extending in functional and it doesnâ€™t declare any new abstract
 *         methods then the new interface is also functional. But an interface
 *         can have one abstract method and any number of default methods and
 *         the interface would still be called an functional interface.
