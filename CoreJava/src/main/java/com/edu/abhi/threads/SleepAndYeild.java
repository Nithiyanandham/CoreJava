 *         Major difference between yield and sleep in Java is that yield()
 *         method pauses the currently executing thread temporarily for giving a
 *         chance to the remaining waiting threads of the same priority to
 *         execute. If there is no waiting thread or all the waiting threads
 *         have a lower priority then the same thread will continue its
 *         execution. The yielded thread when it will get the chance for
 *         execution is decided by the thread scheduler whose behavior is vendor
 *         dependent. Yield method doesnâ€™t guarantee that current thread will
 *         pause or stop but it guarantee that CPU will be relinquish by current
 *         Thread as a result of call to Thread.yield() method in java.
