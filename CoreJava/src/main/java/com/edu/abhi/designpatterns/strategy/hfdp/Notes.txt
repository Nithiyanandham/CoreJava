Disadvantage of Inheritance:
- Code is duplicated across subclasses.
- Runtime Behavior changes are difficult.
- Hard to gain knowledge of all Ducks behavior.
- Changes can unintentionally effect others ducks.


Design Principle 
- Take what varies and "Encapsulate" it, so it wont effect the rest of your code.
- Program to an Interface or Super type not an implementation.
- Favor Composition over Inheritance(only if IS-A relationship is very clear).

Strategy Pattern
Defines a set of encapsulated algorithms that can be swapped to carry out a specific behavior.
