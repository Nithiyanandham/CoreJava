Binary trees
- Property 1: the number of total nodes on each "level" doubles as we move down the tree.
- Property 2: the number of nodes on the last level is equal to the sum of the number of nodes on all other levels (plus 1).


Breadth-first search (BFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a BFS, you first explore all the nodes one step away, 
then all the nodes two steps away, etc. In short analyzing the siblings first and then analyzing the children.

Breadth-first search is often compared with depth-first search.

Advantages:

A BFS will find the shortest path between the starting point and any other reachable node. A depth-first search will not necessarily find the shortest path.
Disadvantages

A BFS on a binary tree generally requires more memory than a DFS.

Depth-first search (DFS) is a method for exploring a tree or graph. In a DFS, 
you go as deep as possible down one path before backing up and trying a different one.
Depth-first search is like walking through a corn maze. You explore one path, hit a dead end, and go back and try a different one.

Depth-first search is often compared with breadth-first search.

Advantages:

Depth-first search on a binary tree generally requires less memory than breadth-first.
Depth-first search can be easily implemented with recursion.
Disadvantages

A DFS doesn't necessarily find the shortest path to a node, while breadth-first search does.
