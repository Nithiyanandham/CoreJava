- Factories handle the details of object creation.
- We can define the Factory method as static method and it will be called a static factory. 
But this has a disadvantage that you cannot subclass the create method to change the behavior.
- All factory patterns encapsulate object creation. 
The Factory pattern encapsulates object creation by letting subclasses decide what object to create. 
- Creator classes are PizzaStore -> NyStylePizzaStore, ChicagoStylePizzaStore
- Product classes are Pizza -> NYStyleCheesePizza,NYStyleVeggiePizza,NYStyleClamPizza,NYStylePepperoniPizza,ChicagoStyleCheesePizza,ChicagoStyleVeggiePizza,ChicagoStyleClamPizza and ChicagoStylePepperoniPizza.
 Factory Pattern then is something like this:
 abstract Product factoryMethod(type)
