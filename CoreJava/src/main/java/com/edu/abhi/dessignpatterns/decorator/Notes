Design Principle
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
 Decorator Pattern -  It allows additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
- It is important for the Decorator to have the same type as the object it is decorating. 
- In case of decorator, inheritance is used for type matching and not to get behavior.
